# TexLab

A Visual Studio code extension with rich editing support for the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting system powered by the [TexLab](https://github.com/efoerster/texlab) language server. It aims to produce high quality code completion results by indexing your used packages as you type.

## Requirements

- A TeX distribution of choice. We highly recommend [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
- A [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/) (or later) runtime environment.

Please make sure that both dependencies are in your PATH environment variable.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

### Build
